# MKPNMF
A project that reproduce the code of a paper "Multi-kernel Projective Nonnegative Matrix Factorization Algorithm" and apply it.

## NMF
The normal NMF algorithm.

## ONMF
The Orthogonal Non-negative Matrix Factorization Algorithm.

## MKPNMF
The main part of the MKPNMF algorithm.

## PaviaU
The testing dataset.

## PaviaU_gt
The gound truth of dataset PaviaU.

## kernel_function
Given the processed dataset_X and multi-kernel function's parameters to get multi-kernel matrices, which are stored in a cell.

## resultSummary
Plot PaviaU_gt, feature maps of PaviaU based NMF and ONMF.

## runTime
Compare the running time among NMF, ONMF and MKPNMF.

## showGroundTruth
Plot PaviaU_gt.

## testNMF/testONMF/testMKPNMF
Test three algorithms.
